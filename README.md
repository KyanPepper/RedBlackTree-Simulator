# RedBlackTree-Simulator
## Programer Kyan Kotschevar-Smead

This interactive tool provides a visual representation of the Red-Black Tree data structure as nodes are inserted and removed. Red-Black Trees are a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and removal operations. As you interact with the simulator, dynamic updates to the tree structure will be visually displayed, allowing you to observe how the tree maintains balance through color-coded nodes. The insertion and removal processes adhere to Red-Black Tree properties, ensuring a balanced and ordered structure. This simulator serves as an educational resource for understanding the mechanics of Red-Black Trees and their ability to maintain balance in response to various operations.
